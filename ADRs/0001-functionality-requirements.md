## Status
To be proposed
## Context
Applicaton will be created for budgeting and executing personal finances.
The user will be responsible for daily/weekly input to the DB through the website using prepared forms (which can me modifed by the user).
Accoring to the data user will put info about his monthly income and then the User will plan monthly expenses (budgeting).
When the plan will be preapred the User will be responsible for tracking (executing) it by enetring the expenses into the website.

Business requirements:
> 1. Only registered users: The application should provide the funcionality only for signed up users.
> 2. The application should provide forms where user input can be posted/delivered. (Input about income, plans and expenses).
> 3. The application should provide charts with general summary (current balance of account, plans vs realization etc.) which can be filtred per day/week/year ect.

## Decision
> The web application should be build on Django with simple and minimalistic fields, graphics and charts from some free CSS etc. (I don't know the exact name of tool that can be used here).
